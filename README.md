## Text Analysis and Sentiment Classification Showcase

## Projects

1. **Introducing Text Analysis Techniques - A Comprehensive Tutorial**
   - File: Introducing Text Analysis Techniques - A Comprehensive Tutorial.ipynb
   - Description: This tutorial covers a wide range of text analysis techniques, focusing on individual sentences. It explores topics such as text cleaning, HTML parsing, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging. Code examples and explanations are provided using Python libraries like NLTK and BeautifulSoup.

2. **Sentiment Analysis using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer**
   - File: SentimentAnalysis_CountTfidf.ipynb
   - Description: This file provides a step-by-step tutorial on sentiment analysis and classification. It covers techniques such as text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer. The sentiment classification is performed using the Multinomial Naive Bayes model.
   - [Train.tsv Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soojung3421/traintsv?select=train.tsv)
   - Description: This dataset is a TSV file containing labeled training data for sentiment analysis.


3. **Sentiment Analysis using NLTK**
   - File: SentimentAnalysis_NLTK.ipynb
   - Description: This file demonstrates sentiment analysis using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) in Python. It explains the pre-processing steps, such as tokenization and stop word removal, and utilizes the Vader sentiment analyzer for sentiment classification. The NLTK's built-in sentiment analysis capabilities are explored and a function is implemented to classify sentences based on a trained model.
