# Text Analysis and Sentiment Classification

This portfolio project focuses on text analysis and sentiment classification using various techniques. The project includes two main files that explore different approaches and models for sentiment analysis.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following files:

1. **SentimentAnalysis_CountTfidf.ipynb**: This file provides a step-by-step tutorial on text analysis and sentiment classification. It covers techniques such as text cleaning, processing, and feature extraction using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer. The Multinomial Naive Bayes model is used for sentiment classification. The file includes code examples, explanations, and comparisons of the results obtained from training and testing.

2. **SentimentAnalysis_NLTK.ipynb**: In this file, another dataset is used to explore sentiment classification using the NLTK Sentiment Analyzer. The focus is on configuring and utilizing the built-in sentiment analysis capabilities of NLTK. A function is implemented to classify sentences based on the trained model.

The main objective of this project is to provide a practical and comprehensive understanding of text analysis techniques and sentiment classification. By studying and experimenting with the code and methodologies presented in the files, users can gain valuable knowledge in the field of natural language processing.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook files: `SentimentAnalysis_CountTfidf.ipynb` and `SentimentAnalysis_NLTK.ipynb`.
4. Run the code cells to explore the text analysis techniques and sentiment classification approaches.


## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive guide to text analysis and sentiment classification. By studying the code and experimenting with different techniques and models, users can gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Feel free to explore the provided files, modify the code, and experiment with additional datasets to further enhance your knowledge in text analysis and sentiment classification.
